Code for Ty Segall's Manpulator music video.
Released under the MIT License. Feel free to use the code (with attribution).

I wanted to release this code so others can see how we created the interactive music video
for Ty Segall's Manipulator. It was designed entirely with HTML5 and javascript.

Unfortunately due to copyright and IP reasons, I can't upload any of the images or videos
used.
